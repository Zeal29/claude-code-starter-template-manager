## Objective
Research comprehensive best practices for learning documentation, tacit knowledge capture, and systematic learning systems. Time-boxed to 3 hours maximum.

## Requirements
- [ ] Research After Action Review (AAR) frameworks
- [ ] Research Lessons Learned systems
- [ ] Research Knowledge Management methodologies
- [ ] Research learning taxonomies (error, insight, pattern, anti-pattern)
- [ ] Research trigger detection patterns (when to capture learning)
- [ ] Research signal vs noise filtering (when to ignore learning)
- [ ] Research integration patterns with work management
- [ ] Document findings with sources cited
- [ ] Identify applicable patterns for our system
- [ ] Time-box to 3 hours maximum

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Research complete (3h time-box)
- [ ] Findings documented with sources
- [ ] Applicable patterns identified
- [ ] Recommendations for T002 design phase
- [ ] Unanswered questions from E002 epic addressed

## Dependencies
- **Blocked by**: E001 completion (need real learnings to validate against)
- **Blocks**: E002-T002 (design based on research findings)

## Git Tracking
```yaml
branch: "master"
commits: []

## Progress Log

### Session 2026-01-17 (Creation)
- Task created as part of E002 Meta-Learning Epic
- Set time-box: 3 hours maximum
- Will start after E001 complete
- **Current State**: Ready, blocked by E001
- **Next Step**: After E001 done, begin comprehensive research
- **Blocker**: E001-T003 through E001-T006

## Assumptions
- 3 hours sufficient for comprehensive research
- Academic/industry best practices applicable to our context
- Research will reveal patterns not obvious from first principles

## Unanswered Questions
- [ ] What research sources are most relevant?
- [ ] Should we focus on software engineering or general knowledge management?
